📘 About This Repository

This repository contains a collection of basic Java projects and exercises that I created while learning Java as my first programming language. It includes simple programs, practice problems, and small projects that helped me understand core programming concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, object-oriented programming, and more. The purpose of this repo is to document my learning journey, reinforce foundational knowledge, and track my progress as I build confidence in Java development.
